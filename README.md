This api was built in node.js and accepts requests for fantasy football data, and allows the user to watch players by reading and writing from their own mongoDB document.

Currently in the progress of migrating to typescript - devDependencies currently required by heroku.

The frontend is built here: matthewjchurch/paninicards.
